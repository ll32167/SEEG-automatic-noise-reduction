# Seizure-detetction

This document is the supporting material for the paper in the 2021 IEEE https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9630651.

This open-source algorithm is aimed for efficiently detecting the electrophysiological seizures specifically designed for Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG).

The demo code (SZD.ipynb) is written in Python 3 and to run the it, following libraries and toolboxes are needed:

Numpy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Scipy

MNE

The helper.ipynb is to split edf file into shorter clips for a faster process. 

The figures related to the paper is in wiki section.
